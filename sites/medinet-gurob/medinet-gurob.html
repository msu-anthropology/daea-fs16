         <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


<p>Medinet Gurob (Medinet el-Gurob: City of the Crows) has a long history that spans from the protodynastic all the way to the Ptolemaic period, with the exception of no activity found during the Middle Kingdom. However, what is interesting is that the site itself seems to have a relatively short occupation timeframe when compared to the datable evidence of the archaeological findings. First excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1888-9, Gurob has been identified with the ancient town of Mer-Wer, which was established by Thutmose III as a royal harem palace, and appears to have flourished during the reign of Amenhotep III (1) . Gurob combines a New Kingdom settlement that has had two main occupation phases -- the first phase being during the early/mid 18th dynasty and the second phase being of the Ramessid period -- with multiple cemetery sites to the north and south of the main town enclosure that range from the Protodynastic to the Ptolemaic. The royal harem palace and town established here were the first major phase of occupation with the second phase superseding the earlier town and transforming the site’s character into a small Ramessid town (2).</p>
<p>Not much attention has been placed on Medinet Gurob. When the first excavation happened on the site by Flinders Petrie in 1888-9 and then again in 1889-90, Petrie was also excavating Hawara and Kahun simultaneously leading to unsatisfactory and disorganized findings (2). Then rapid, short excavations occurred at the beginning of the 20th century but shortly stopped in the 1920s. During the latter half of the 20th century Gurob became an Egyptian military site, and no archaeologist was welcome. It wasn’t until 1984, shortly after the site had ceased to be a military area, when archaeologist Peter Lacovara paid a one-day visit to the area and made a stratigraphic section drawing in the southern part of the site which appeared to confirm that there were two distinct phases of settlement at Gurob, an earlier (harem) phase and the later Ramessid phase (3). However, nothing more was done at the site until 2005, when a team from Liverpool got to work. Working from 2005-2012 their principle aim was to survey and seek confirmation of the overall layout and chronology of the settlement area of the site through extensive, non-invasive geophysical survey and the collection of surface pottery (1).</p>

</figure>
<p>Medinet Gurob is a New Kingdom settlement and cemetery site at the south-eastern end of the Faiyum region, not far from El-Lahun and Hawara, that was animatedly occupied from at least the early Eighteenth Dynasty until the late Ramesside period. Situated on the desert’s edge and built upon sterile arolian sands (4), Medinet Gurob is approximately 4 kilometers west of the point where the Bahr Youssef channel begins to turn northwest to enter the Faiyum. The ancient name for the town, Mer-Wer, meaning either “great channel” or “great canal,” derived its name from the Bahr Youssef channel next to which it was located (5). Interesting enough, at the beginning of the New Kingdom period increasing control over the water input into the Faiyum lead to the Bahr Youssef being diverted from its usual northward course into the Faiyum basin and, instead, the water flow was being controlled from Medinet Gurob in order to create a new channel that flowed past the town on its eastern side (6).</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 70s, Gurob became an Egyptian military site owned by the Beni Suef Governorate, and no archaeologists were welcome. When archaeologists were welcomed back to the site in the 1980s they saw that a vast amount of damage was done not only by the military but by local farmers who used the soil and iron-rich mud for their personal use.</p>

     <h3><strong>Site Description</strong></h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>From the very beginning of the first excavations done at Medinet Gurob by Flinders Petrie the layout of Medinet Gurob had the schematics of what we now know today to be that of a New Kingdom royal city (3). David O’Connor’s defines such a settlement as one that combines a major and permanent royal residence with the offices and residences of a substantial part of the national government (7). The New Kingdom settlement at Gurob follows the same basic described layout, with the palace in the center of the city and houses spreading out to the north and the south, and burial grounds on the periphery (3).</p>
<p>However, being more specific, while Medinet Gurob is a royal city it is specifically a royal harem palace city. The layout of a harem palace included a pair of adjacent buildings, each divided into two by partition walls, with one usually being larger than the other, and that one of the buildings was dedicated for residential use and the other building was divided up into smaller rooms that was probably used for storage (3).</p>
<p>It is important to note that by ancient Egyptian standards their definition of harem should not be confused with the modern-day Western perception of what a harem is – i.e. an Ottoman harem that leads Westerners to conjure up visions of beautiful veiled women surronding a sultant. Ancient Egyptians, especially during the New Kingdom, defined royal harems as permanent smaller residences built to house the surplus wives and concubines of the king, their children, and the women’s retainers due to the practice of polygamous marriages by the royal leaders (8).</p>
<p>In the instance of Medinet Gurob, it is believed that Thutmose III built a harem palace originally for senior royal women (9), but future New Kingdom kings stationed lesser wives, women who lost the interest of the king – i.e. elderly wives or non-favorites of the king, and foreigners married to the king primarily for diplomatic links with the Hittite and Mitannian royal courts (2). Evidence from Papyrus UCL 32795 found at Gurob references the marriage of Ramesses and a daughter of Hittite king Hattusili, who was given the Egyptian name Neferura-Who-Beholds-Horus, states “The king’s wife Maathorneferura (may she live) (the daughter) of the ruler of Khatti,” (2). This papyrus fragment was found along with a laundry list and a 28 long cubit piece of cloth belonging to Maathornederura at Medinet Gurob (10).</p>

  <img src="imgs/stelae.jpeg" width="100%" />
  <figcaption><em><strong>Image 2</strong> - "Stelae of Thutmose III, from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology"</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These harem-palaces were also independent, both physically and economically, of the main royal residence (11). Medinet Gurob itself when it was known as Mer-Wer, as seen in the Wilbour Papyrus, was an important financial institution, owning all the surrounding land and its crops and with clear rights over the labor of the local peasant farmers (11). The ladies who lived in the harem-palace ran a thriving textile and weaving industry (11). Evidence from Papyrus UCL 32795 from the Petrie collection from Gurob contains references to royal linen, head-cloths, bag-tunic and triangular cloths – all of the finest quality (2).</p>
<p>As evidence suggests, married male administrators resided at the palace in order to serve as scribes and accountants charged with the task of helping to control the business interests of the royal women (11). Three stelae from the temple of Tuthmose III at the site bear the names of Usermaatra-em-heb, who was the deputy of the harem of Mer-Wer, Iy, who was the overseer of the royal harem, and Djarwy, who was servant of the harem. An object from the palace itself is inscribed with the name of Sety, who was known to be the royal scribe overseer of the women of the harem of Mer-Wer (2).</p>
<p>The site itself consists of a New Kingdom town and cemeteries grouped along the desert’s edge. The main New Kingdom settlement has an enclosure wall encircling the whole town. Within the main enclosure wall are three separate, smaller enclosure walls: the north enclosure, the central enclosure, and the south enclosure (12). Within the central enclosure was a limestone temple dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek that was constructed during Thutmose III’s reign. Adjoining the enclosure’s northwest wall was a mudbrick shrine that had etchings of Thutmose III on the walls. The north enclosure may have contained the town’s earliest inhabitants with the domestic structures preceding late 18th/early 19th Dynasty shaft tombs. The south enclosure was where the harem palace, as well as the town that succeeded the harem-palace during the end of the New Kingdom period, resided (2). The mud-brick harem palace is set on the southern end of the large enclosure and measures 240 x 225 meters (3). The northern building is taken to be the palace, and the slightly smaller building to its south was an economic building that housed the servants and retainers. Included in the harem complex was a central block of living rooms and lofty pillared halls, several narrow storerooms in the northern part of the enclosure (3), and just to the east of the palace (3) was a small mud-brick temple of Tuthmose III (11).</p>
<p>Southwest of the town a New Kingdom cemetery is located. North of the town another New Kingdom cemetery accompanied by a Ptolemaic cemetery can be found (13). One kilometer south of the town is a small New Kingdom village and five cemeteries. One cemetery is from the late Predynastic (Naqada III/Dynasty 0), three New Kingdom cemeteries (one that was specifically for infant burials) and a 19th Dynasty animal cemetery (12). Throughout the surrounding area other cemeteries were found with burials dating back to the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate period. Overall the site shows at least fourteen separate burial groupings surrounding the main complex.</p>

<h3><strong>Excavations and Results</strong></h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>Starting in 1888-90 the first excavations at Medinet Gurob were performed by Flinders Petrie. During his excavations he uncovered part of the New Kingdom town, a large building that he identified as a temple within the southern enclosure wall, and cemeteries dating to the New Kingdom and the Ptolemaic period to the north (2).</p>
<p>One cemetery from the New Kingdom period is southwest of the town and another New Kingdom cemetery north of the town. Within the New Kingdom cemetery to the north, Petrie dates active burials from the early 18th Dynasty to the Ramesside period. Lower and middle class individuals were buried here with their graves consisting of oval or rectangular pits, 125-150cm deep, with no superstructures (13). Ranging from moderate to well-off in social status, the simplest of burials either had bodies wrapped in reeds or matting, or the bodies were laid upon a layer of reeds. In some cases, mudbricks were placed around or over the bodies, or the bodies were placed in a coffin of either mudbrick, wood or pottery (13).</p>
<p>Other highlights from his findings include Petrie dating the construction of the temple to Thutmose III, a large amount of pottery shards and faience jewelry that linked Gurob to the period and city of Tell-el Amarna, and in the cemetery dating to the Ptolemaic era that laid on a rise of the desert to the north of the town, Petrie found many Greek and Demotic texts ranging from private letters and wills to works of the Greek classics that were used as a substitution for cloth when manufacturing cartonnage mummy cases (13).</p>
<p>From his findings Petrie concluded that the initial temple for the 18th dynasty was dismantled and on its foundation, housing was built on top of it at a later date, which was the basis of how future archaeologists understood the chronology of the site. What was interesting, he noted, was that while there were a lot of beads, weaving materials, and other goods relating to domestic life, no furniture or decoration within the interior of the structures was found.</p>
<p>However, by Petrie’s standards the work that was done at Medinet Gurob throughout the two seasons was rather subpar. During the first season (1888-9) Petrie was simultaneously working at the sites of Hawara and Kahun, and, therefore, he was evidently devoting only a limited amount of attention to Gurob (2). During the second season (1889-90) the work was not supervised by Petrie but by his lackey Hughes-Hughes. Petrie writes, “As I was fully occupied with Kahun, I handed Gurob over to Mr. Hughes-Hughes, who was out in Egypt with me. This work then was under his care; and beyond showing him the ground, and making a plan of the remains after the work was over, I had no responsibility about it” (14) It turns out that because of this hand-off, the excavation strategy and the publication that came out of this second excavation season were and still are relatively unclear and, as a result, no one as of yet has been able to obtain a clear understanding of the site geography (2).</p>

 </figure>
<p>After Flinders Petrie’s initial publications that came out right before the turn of the century more publications were published focusing around Medinet Gurob. In 1901 publications came out from J.E. Quibell and M.E. Chassinat claiming that artifacts, like the one seen in the image to your right, plundered from the tomb of a woman named “Twty” around the vicinity of Medinet Gurob bore the names of Amenhotep II, Queen Tiye and Amenhotep IV (5). Artifacts such as this started to solidify Petrie’s belief that this site was tied strongly to the 18th Dynasty.</p>
<p>In 1903-4 further excavations at Gurob were undertaken by C.T. Currelly and W.L.S. Loat. From their excavations a small New Kingdom village along with five surrounding cemeteries 50 meters south from the main town were discovered. The cemeteries include a late Predynastic (Naqada III/Dynasty 0) cemetery, three New Kingdom cemeteries, and a 19th Dynasty animal cemetery (15).</p>
<p>Within one the New Kingdom cemeteries Loat discovered it was dedicated to infant burials (15). Here, the infants’ bodies were placed in oval ceramic jars and buried in small pits. Another New Kingdom cemetery that Loat surveyed had burials belonging to officials from the harem-palace as seen from excavated tomb markers (1). Lastly, Loat excavated a 19th Dynasty cemetery whose main purpose was for animal burials. Animals ranging from oxen, goats and fish could be found. The oxen and goats were buried in shallow, irregular pits with the pits usually containing more than one animal (15). Interesting enough when it came to the fish burials, which were primarily Nile perch, they were buried in carefully dug pits, often for a single fish for each pit (15).</p>
<p>Also, it is important to note that within the Naqada III/Dynasty 0 cemetery that Loat identified, evidence provides us with the earliest activities at Gurob. This cemetery included fifty graves, oblong in shape with their depths varying from 60-90cm, on a small hill approximately one kilometer south of the town (15). Loat originally dated this cemetery to a prehistoric period but later archaeologists re-classified this cemetery as Naqada III/Dynasty 0, however, due to Loat’s excavations we now know when the earliest activities occurred.</p>

  <img src="imgs/queen.jpg" width="100%" />
  <figcaption><em><strong>Image 4</strong> - "Head Bust of Queen Tiye"</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Outside of cemeteries Loat also discovered a small mud-brick shrine dedicated to Thutmose III, adjoining the northwest wall of the central enclosure.</p>
<p>In 1905 German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt briefly re-excavated the site (2). Borchardt was prompted to re-examine Gurob after the acquisition of the portrait head of, who we now know is, Queen Tiye – the principle wife of Amenhotep III, mother of Akhenaten and grandmother to Tutankhamun. It was he who suggested that the main enclosure-wall contained not a temple – as Petrie had suggested – but a late 18th-Dynasty harem palace, as well as the town itself at a later time (1). It was from Borchardt’s insight that we are now able to label Medinet Gurob as a harem palace town and systematically examine the sight in the context of a harem structure.</P>
<p>In 1920, British archaeologists Guy Brunton and Reginald Engelbach were the last to excavate Gurob during the 20th century (2). Mainly, they were dedicated to acquiring a comprehensive survey of the of the surrounding cemeteries, but thanks to them we now own an extended comprehension of the chronology of Gurob through periods of time when the area was used for mortuary purposes. They first looked the Naqada III/Dynasty 0 cemetery where they excavated sixteen burials in which the bodies were contracted, lying on their left side with their heads to the south. (16) Originally dated by Loat to be a prehistoric cemetery, Brunton and Engelbach re-dated the site to the protodynastic, specially to the Naqada III/Dynasty 0 era, based on the ceramic evidence in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Brunton and Engelbach then excavated an Old Kingdom cemetery. Of the 156 individual burials there, traces of coffins were found for only seven graves. Most of the burials were contracted, usually on the left side with the head to the north/northeast, and placed in irregularly cut graves in the loose sand lined with mud-brick (16). Both Brunton and Engelbach reflected about the general poverty of these burials, remarking that even pots were “almost absent.” However, while the Gurob Old Kingdom burials have been interpreted as low-status ones, they demonstrate the importance of burial ritual for these individuals (9). Brunton and Englebach noted that this area also yielded traces of mudbrick walls, possibly the remnants of an Old Kingdom settlement that was constructed prior to the New Kingdom occupation and previously unknown to the archaeological community.</p>
<p>While excavating the Old Kingdom cemetery Brunton and Engelbach noticed the mixture of later burials from the First Intermediate period found within the cemetery. They dated the tombs from ceramic evidence and from the positioning of the body. Meaning, the bodies were found laid on their sides, a practice that was primarily discontinued by the 12th Dynasty. Add that to the narrow coffins the bodies were in, which were only a pre-12th Dynasty type, led to their conclusion of the findings being that of First Intermediate burials (16).</p>
<p>Within the main New Kingdom cemetery, northeast of the town, Brunton and Engelbach re-excavated the area where Flinders Petrie first excavated Brunton and Engelbach did not report finding any canopic jars, indicating that bodies were not mummified for their burials (16).</p>
<p>To the west of the town, Brunton and Engelbach surveyed an area that contained approximately 500 shaft tombs belonging to officials and other important people (2). Included in these findings was the tomb of Pi-Ramessu, the son of Set I and elder brother of Ramesses II (8). This was another bit of evidence supporting Borchardt’s claim that the structure within the southern enclosure was indeed that of a harem palace due to the remains of royal children and women, and high standing officials being found around the site.</p>
<p>Outside of their cemetery excavations Brunton and Engelbach surveyed the northwest corner of the town where they thought a fort once stood (16). Behind the fort are the remains of a small, square structure on top of which was evidence of kilns and glass production dating to the New Kingdom, which in turn supports the claim that harem palaces, especially that of Mer-Wer (Medinet Gurob), were independent economic structures.</p>
<p>In 1978 Cambridge Egyptologist Barry Kemp synthesized the results of the various excavations to construct an impression of a New Kingdom harem-town which might have superseded the earlier village, but was itself eventually transformed into a small Ramessid town (1). This construction of synthesized data was the first of its kind leading to a visual representation of the site.</p>

</figure>
<p>It wasn’t until 1984, shortly after the site had ceased to be militarily occupied, that Peter Lacovara paid a one-day visit to the site and was the first archaeologist to step foot on the area since the 1920s (1). Lacovara made a stratigraphic section drawing in the southern part of the site which appeared to confirm that there were two distinct phases of settlement at Gurob, an earlier harem phase and the later Ramessid phase (2). Lacovara also made the breakthrough of creating a formula for a harem palace structure based of the findings of Medinet Gurob since the site itself gives us the most comprehensive image of an Egyptian royal harem.</p>
<p>However, nothing more was done at the site until 2005 when archaeologists from the University of Liverpool began work at Medinet Gurob on March 31, 2005 and the operation itself has since grown to include other institutions such as University College London and the University of Copenhagen. Active excavations on site in Egypt have since ceased since 2012.</p>
<p>During their active surveying of the area their principle aims of the survey were to seek confirmation of the overall layout and chronology of the settlement area. They had made excellent progress in the first six seasons of work and have since made satisfactory progress on the several elements of the overall place for the site: mapping, pottery surface collection, auger boring, geophysical survey, and excavation (17). As well as mapping some of the basic features of the town site, the excavation team have also begun to produce more detailed plans of some of the best surviving architectural features, such as the enigmatic circular mud-brick constructions in the northern palace building and a section of the town wall to the north-east of the main palace area (6).</p>
<figure style="float: left; width 35%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom 5px;">
  <img src="imgs/pottery.jpeg" width="100%" />
  <figcaption><em><strong>Image 6</strong> - "Mycenean vase found at Gurob, from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology"</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After their 2008 season, when the team was dedicated to surveying the wider landscape around Medinet Gurob in order to examine the spread of cultural material through the cultivated areas next to the site, they found that the spread of cultural material extended well past the edges of the excavated area (17). The excavation team concluded after focusing their attention to the adjacent areas of the main site that the spread of material cultural lies partly with the local agricultural activities of the farmers and also from the natural movements of the soils from the canal leading to deeply buried cultural material that can only be reached through auger boring (17). As a result of these findings the dig team has focused extensively on expanding their auger boring operations.</p>
<p>During their 2011 to 2012 seasons they had to deal with tomb looting. It was especially prevalent when they were looking at burials that had physical remains from more than one body that happened to have multiple lower limbs mixed together thus disturbing the chronological timeframe (6). Multiple pottery and other funerary pits have shown signs of disturbance not from the legitimate excavation teams, which resulted in a large portion of their time in the field being dedicated to recording areas that showed evidence of looting and illicit excavation (6).</p>
<p>However, what good that did come out of excavations during the spring of 2012 was monumental. What the team had dubbed the “industrial area” of the site, which is in reference to when Brunton and Engelbach surveyed the northwest corner of the town where they uncovered the remains of pottery kilns dating to the New Kingdom, proved to be the uncovering of a pottery workshop. The team specifically excavated the two kilns from the area and were surprised to see that while there was clear evidence of active use for a pottery business the structures of the kilns relied closely in appearance to the glass-making kilns at Amarna thus making it possible that the kilns at Medinet Gurob could have been a multi-functional workshop for more than one good (6).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that from the close excavation and archival work of the ceramic artifacts found from their systematic surface pottery survey they have collected over 26,000 potsherds, including 1,600 diagnostic sherds – rims, bases, handles, decorated body sherds and gaming counters, nearly all dating to the New Kingdom, particularly relating to the 18th and 19th dynasties (6). Not only has the pottery been vital in establishing the chronology of Medinet Gurob, but upon close examination the hypothesis -- Medinet Gurob serving as important area for foreign goods and trade, especially pottery from the Canaanite area and the Mycenaean culture from mainland Greece -- was proven to be true as seen from the 26 shards of Canaanite pottery and 10 shards from Mycenaean pottery found (6).</p>
<p>From recent excavations the Gurob Harem Palace Project team has concluded that starting at the beginning of the New Kingdom period increasing control over the water input into the Faiyum was present, in that the Bahr Youssef was being diverted from its usual northward course to the Faiyum basin and instead the water flow was being controlled from Medinet Gurob (6). As a result, during its occupation period the inhabitants of Medinet Gurob made it possible for the creation of a new channel that flowed past the town on its eastern side.</p>
<p>Finally, as of 2014 the team is well advanced in producing a fundamental corpus of the characteristic fabric and forms of pottery vessels at Gurob, which can subsequently be compared with the existing New Kingdom corpora at Amarna, Memphis and other urban sites that may have also had harem palaces (17). The auger boring, alongside the geophysical techniques, has allowed the team to gain a clearer sense of the sub-surface remains at Gurob, revealing more details of the harem palace and the surrounding community and landscape (2).</p>

<h3><stong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>Our knowledge of ancient Egyptian harems is far from complete. Throughout Egypt we have glimpses of what a harem palace could look like as seen at other archaeological sites like Amarna, Memphis, Thebes and Malkata yet, of all the harems tentatively identified so far, Gurob has offered up the most information. Other potential harem sites don’t have the archaeological evidence that Medinet Gurob offers. Ranging from papyrus, stelae, textile, human burials and other archaeological evidence these artifacts all provide us with a full picture of what went on in a harem palace. And Gurob, as suspected, will have yet even more to reveal upon future excavations.</p>
