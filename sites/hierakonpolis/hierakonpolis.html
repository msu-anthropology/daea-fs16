<h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr>
<p>Hierakonpolis is a predynastic site partially located under the modern village of Muisaat in Upper Egypt. The site was occupied from about 3200 – 2600 BC, reaching it’s peak during the late predynastic period to the early dynastic times, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Redford, Donald B.

">(Redford 2013)</a>. After the dynastic period, Hierakonpolis declined to being a provincial center, due to changing environmental and political factors, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Redford, Donald B.

<br><br>The site is split into two archaeological zones. The first of which is located in the low mounds in the flood plains, that house the remains of a town and the temple mound, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Redford, Donald B.

The second of the two zones is a series of interrelated sites scattered across three and a half kilometers in the low desert and goes on for about two kilometers west in the a wadi of the western desert, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Redford, Donald B.

Excavations at Hierakonpolis began in the late 1890s with James Quibell and Fredrick Green, and since 1967 by a handful of different institutes have been a part of intense excavations and survey expeditions. Early excavations by Quibell and Green began in 1898, and focused on a 4th millennium B.C. temple, that was contemporary with emergence of Egyptian civilization, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016. 
">(Shaw 32)</a>. These excavations revealed some of the more prevalent artifacts discovered include the Narmer Palette and Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead in what is called the main deposit, which was placed between two walls that were dated to the Old Kingdom, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016. 
">(Shaw 32)</a>. However, the Narmer Palette it self was not found in the main deposit, it was just in the near by proximity, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016. 
">(Shaw 32)</a>. The main deposit also yielded hundreds of plain mace heads, animal figures in green pottery, ivory statuettes, plaques, and elaborate plates and cups associated with royal names were discovered, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Petrie, W.

">(Shaw 34)</a>.
<br><br>Moving into the twentieth century, excavations at Hierakonpolis continued to reveal valuable artifacts and information regarding Predynastic and early Dynastic Egyptian society. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, who have for a long time shown interest in excavating a predynastic site, began excavations at Hierakonpolis in 1933 and continued through 1944, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Lansing, Ambrose.

In 1958 Michael Hoffman worked on locality HK29, in which a clay paved court yard was discovered dated to the Naqada II period, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.

<h3>Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Hierakonpolis has been seen as a vital site in demonstrating predynastic culture and unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Throughout excavations at Hierakonpolis it has become evident that the strategic location of the city led to trade relations with Sudan, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the mineral resources of the eastern desert, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Castillos, Juan J. The Place of Hierakonpolis in the Egyptian Predynastic. (2006): n. pag. Print.
">(Castillos 2)</a>. At the site preservation and evidence of settlement is much better preserved then at sites located more north,  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Lansing, Ambrose. Museum's Excavations at Hierakonpolis. Metropolitan Museum of Art, Nov. 1935. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
">(Lansing 37)</a>. Excavation at Hierakonpolis has revealed a lot about predynastic culture, including how when summer rains decreased in the dessert, thus causing inundations of the Nile river to decrease, settlement moved closer to the water,  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Hoffman, Michael Allen. Culture History and Cultural Ecology at Hierakonpolis from the Paleolithic Times. (1971): n. pag. Print.
">(Hoffman 73)</a>.  Multiple artifacts have also indicated the importance of Hierakonpolis in the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Artifacts such as the Narmer Palette and Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead help to tell the story of unification in Egypt, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016. 
">(Shaw 34)</a>. Excavations at Hierakonpolis have also focused on mortuary customs, for example HK6, otherwise known as the Pillared Hall, which is the earliest known evidence of above ground funerary architecture,  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Stevenson, Alice. The Egyptian Predynastic and State Formation. Journal of Archaeological Research 24.4 (2016): 421-68. Web.">(Stevenson 433)</a>. Other evidence found at HK29A shows evidence of ritual feasting, due to the large amounts of faunal remains recovered,  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Stevenson, Alice. The Egyptian Predynastic and State Formation. Journal of Archaeological Research 24.4 (2016): 421-68. Web.">(Stevenson 433)</a>. More modern surveys and excavations have shown specialized craft production and have given a full picture of the city and predynastic culture that gave rise to the world’s fist nation state, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Redford, Donald B.

">(Redford 2013)</a>.  Hierakonpolis is valuable in the sense that it allows for an understanding of predynastic culture and society and the process of unifying Upper and Lower Egypt.
