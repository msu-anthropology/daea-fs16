      <h1>Tell Edfu</h1>
      <h3>Old Kingdom - Middle Kingdom</h3>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the examp-->
		 
		 <p>Along the west bank of the nile in southern Egypt is an ancient settlement neighboring the modern day city of Edfu. The remains of this settlement date to several periods in Egyptian history going as far back as the Old Kingdom. The history of this site is preserved in its stratigraphy covering three thousand years of occupation. The latest excavations performed at this settlement have significantly increased knowledge about ancient Egyptian urbanism. Referred to as Tell Edfu, this site was a provincial capital of an upper Egyptian nome, hosting several administrative complexes.

<h3>Location and Geography</h3>
<hr>
		 <p>The modern day city of Edfu is located in southern Egypt on the west bank of the Nile river about half-way between the cities of Aswan and Luxor. The pharaonic settlement is located adjacent to modern day Edfu and just a few meters away from the Ptolemaic temple.  The site is referred to as a Tell; a tell is an artificial mound created by layers and layers of settlements being built on top of each other due to continuous occupation of a site over a long period of time. The ancient settlement was located in the floodplain of the Nile valley and was likely densely populated(Moeller, 2010).</p>

		 <h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The most well known element of the site is the Ptolemaic Temple of Edfu. The temple was built between the third and first century B.C. and was dedicated to the Egyptian deity, Horus. During Egyptologist, Barry Kemp’s surveys he found evidence of a settlement dating to the Old and Middle Kingdom. The settlement includes several key features. One of these features is a number of large enclosure walls. These walls date to the Old Kingdom with one running north to south and then turning at a right angle and reaching to the east. Another major feature of the site is a large columned hall. Archaeologists believe this hall was part of a middle kingdom administrative complex (Moeller, 2012). Other adjoining rooms have been found near the hall that were likely part of this complex. Excavation of the hall has yielded several artifacts including ostraca, clay figurines, and a high number of seal impressions (Moeller, 2010).</p>

		 <p>A grain silo court dating to the 17th dynasty is another major feature of the site. These silos are significant in that they have been well preserved. Most of the silos still have walls that reach a height of four meters and the point to where they begin to form a round dome is visible (Moeller, 2010). Other features of the site include a step pyramid about 5 kilometers west of Edfu, called the Edfu South Pyramid. Dating to the 3rd dynasty, the pyramid is not believed to have served a funerary purpose (Moeller, 2010). </p>

<h3>Past and Present Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Several excavation projects have taken place at Tell Edfu throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, focusing on different aspects of the site. Henri Henne, a papyrology professor at the University of Lille published the first report of field work done at the site from the 1921-1922 field season (Moeller, 2010). His work focused on the excavation of Coptic and Roman remains as well as tombs from an early Islamic cemetery (Moeller, 2010). Several years later French Egyptologist, Maurice Alliot, concentrated on mastaba tombs at the south-western edge of the site. These tombs dated to the Old Kingdom and were part of an elite cemetery (Moeller, 2010). From 1937 to 1939 Kazimierz Michalowski and Bernard Bruyere focused on the western side of the tell excavating Roman and Byzantine features. Due to World War 2 archaeological excavations paused. The next major studies of the site were done in the 1970s by Barry Kemp and Manfred Bietak. Kemp and Bietak both conducted surveys of the site noting the potential importance of the pharaonic settlement. This settlement is where most of the excavation in Edfu is happening in the 21st century.</p>
<br>
<p>Excavations at Tell Edfu are currently underway. The Tell Edfu Project began in 2001 by the University of Cambridge and was directed by Nadine Moeller. Today, Dr. Moeller is still directing this project, however, she is now at the University of Chicago. In 2001 the project team began surveys that would continue for four seasons. During their surveys, the team studied how the site developed over time with a primary focus on the exposed enclosure walls (Moeller, 2010). These surveys resulted in finding the settlements oldest section. The oldest section of the site was located near the eastern side of the tell by the Ptolemaic Temple of Edfu.</p>
<br>
<p>After the four survey seasons were complete, excavations officially started in 2005. The Tell Edfu Project team concentrated on the eastern section  of the site that they previously determined was the oldest portion of the settlement near the Ptolemaic temple enclosure wall. Excavation was focused on the large circular structures that Henri Henne identified to be grain silos. The structures were made of mud brick and clearly visible among layers of fill (Moeller, 2010). The first assignment for the team was to clean up the area. The area they were focused on was about 25 meters east to west and 50 meters north to south. All non-in situ fill was removed and excavation of the silos commenced (Moeller, 2010).</p>

</figure>
<p>Over the span of five seasons from 2005 to 2009, the team documented the presence of ten phases of occupation throughout the site. The first phase included the large, mud brick enclosure wall of the temple. This wall sliced through the entire tell, destroying part of phase two, the ptolemaic houses on top of the tell. Another wall, about 23 meters to the west, runs parallel to this wall and dates to the Old Kingdom. Phase 3 is made up of houses from the late period that have features such as square cellars, thin walls, and large courtyards. Refuse layers dating to the New Kingdom make up phase four. These layers cover most of the area under excavation. One of the layers is thick ash with a large deposit of ostraca. The fifth phase includes a Second Intermediate Period granary court with 18 silos. The sixth phase consists of the columned hall and its adjacent rooms that make up the administrative complex. This complex dates to the late middle kingdom. Within the complex the team has found artifacts such as seal-impressions, pottery, and ostraca. The seventh phase displays evidence of occupation in the early Middle Kingdom through seal impressions from that time (Moeller, 2009). Phase eight includes more seal impressions, pottery, and some exposed mud brick walls from the First Intermediate Period. Phase nine includes late Old Kingdom enclosure walls that run north to south and phase 10 consists of early Old Kingdom remains (Moeller, 2010).</p>
<br>
<p>The excavations in 2005 focused heavily on the grain silos. The first goal of the team was to clear away the loose rubble that covered the site. Nine silos were either partially or entirely excavated by the end of the season in 2009.  The study of the silos identified aspects of the structures that showed what height the silos likely reached. Based on the height they found the silos could contain over 30 tons of barley or over 40 tons of wheat if filled to their maximum. They also found that some silos were better preserved than others. By studying the stratigraphy the team has been able to figure out whether some silos were being used at the same time as other silos (Moeller, 2010). One interesting feature of the larger silos is that some of them have smaller silos connected to them. According to the team this was a way to add on more space for storage while saving money and resources (Moeller, 2010). Examinations of the silos has revealed more information on their use and construction. One thing the team learned was that multiple layers of plaster were applied to both the inside and outside surfaces of the silos over time, with the goal of improving their ability to store grain (Moeller, 2010).</p>

</figure>
<p>The late Middle Kingdom columned hall initially consisted of six column bases made of sandstone found in the building’s original floor. The column bases had diameters of 73 to 76 cm, Throughout the field seasons from 2005 to 2009 excavation uncovered rooms attached to the hall as well as some of the exterior walls (Moeller, 2010). This building is believed to have served administrative purposes based on its architecture and the artifacts found in association with it (Moeller, 2009). As for architecture, the team compares its structure to other Middle Kingdom official buildings. The artifacts found with the columned hall’s floor include a couple hundred seal impressions which were used on various types of containers that would have stored goods traveling into Edfu from different places (Moeller, 2012).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>Archaeological excavations at Tell Edfu have provided insight about several phases of ancient Egyptian history through the excavations completed within the last century. Edfu's amazing preservation has allowed archaeologists to learn about its occupation going back 3000 years. This site’s preservation is extremely important as many ancient urban settlements are not accessible for study. Many have been destroyed and/or buried under modern cities. The structures of this site help explain how the former capital of an upper Egyptian nome was managed. Studying grain silos and administrative buildings has provided archaeological data on how ancient towns fed their people and managed their resources and economy. Tell Edfu and the team of scientists studying it are providing the world with more information about what ancient Egyptian towns consisted of and how these people lived.</p>
