She had two tombs built for her, the original was KV20 and the later tomb was KV60. KV20, however, only briefly held the final resting place of Hatshepsut. This was largely due to later pharaohs removing the royal remains of individuals buried in the Valley of the Kings to safer locations in the attempt to protect their predecessors’ physical remains from looters. Just recently her remains were identified from a known artifact, Hatshepsut’s canopic box, which was recovered from KV20 by Howard Carter in the early 1900s. The site itself has only be entered a handful of times due to the dangerous conditions of the tomb. KV20 was one of the first tombs built in the Valley of the Kings, which gives reason as to why there is a lack of reliefs and overall text lining the walls. Compared to later tombs, KV20 is strikingly bare, but its sheer length and depth surpasses the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings.
